Manifesto
---------

1. Make parts of package independent. So that when using templating system you
donot need use HTTP handlers. However some parts may rely on as few as possible
general utils (such as logging system - it's not part of standard library yet).

2. Make interchangeable modules for one problem but different implementations.
So that we can make script for plain CGI we can easy switch to mod_python -
changing the only base class for our application.

3. Do not make ready-to-use systems part of package. Their should be presented
as examples.
